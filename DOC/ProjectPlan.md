# Project Plan

**Author**: Team60

## 1 Introduction

This project is to build an Android app that will be to used to compare job offers with benefits, in different locations, and other aspects beyond salary. The primary user of this app can either be a new graduate or anyone looking for job. It is intended to be simple, intuitive and user friendly. It can help the user to quickly find the best job among the various job offers.

This project plan document summarizes the planned process for the implementation of the application.

## 2 Process Description

We use unified software process to develop the application. The processes includes four phases : 

Inception, Elaboration, Construction and Transition.

### Inception

Inception phase is where idea becomes the vision of the end product. In this phase, we determined the requirement with our customer. We create a user case model document, which is a vision document with general vision of the project's requirements, key features, and main constraints. We come up with initial architecture design based on the requirement. We estimate, that the project will be implemented in  two weeks with four (4) developers.

### Elaboration

Elaboration phase is where we analyze problem domain, establish architectural foundation, eliminate highest risk elements, and refine plan of activities and estimates. In this phase, the requirement will be finalized. We will create the various architecture design documents, such as class diagram and component diagram. We will finish the almost completed version of use-case model in UseCaseModel.md. We will also add supplementary requirements, including non-function requirements in ExtraRequirements.md. In addition,a test plan will be created to discuss how we test the program in TestPlan.md. We will then, refine our project plan in ProjectPlan.md. We believe we will be able to finish the project in two weeks.

### Construction

Construction phase is the longest phase, where most of our development will be completed. In this phase, we will develop the application based on our architecture design. We will break the code down into different tasks. The tasks are assigned to different team members to complete. Our documents, such as class diagram, test plan, and component diagram will be updated as we finish our tasks. Every feature of the application will be thoroughly tested. In the end, all the documents should be finalized. The application should be fully tested and ready for beta release.

### Transition

Transition is the last phase of unified process, where our application will be delivered. The project is completed. All documentation should be done and we are ready to maintain the application. We will fix any issue found after deployment in this phase. We may receive a new feature request from our customer. We may also have new release of our application and start the process again. 

## 3 Team

### This team consist of four following members:
    Jason Monroe (jmonroe36)
    Olutosin Adewuyi (oadewuyi6)
    Qitong Ye(qye38)
    Yanqin Tan (ytan312)


### Roles:

- Project Manager: Will be responsible for process planning, organizing, and completion of the project. The personnel needs to ensure all the team members finish their tasks on time and the project is deliever on time.

- Lead Quality Assurance: Will be responsible for ensuring the quality of the application meets the highest standard customer require. The personnel should be able to detect any problem the application may have before its delivery and should also verify that the application is working properly. 

- Lead Architect: Will be responsible for designing the application. The personnel will gather requirement from customer and create high-level product specification and design documents. Also responsible for making high level decision about the application.

- Lead Tester: will be responsible for testing the application. The personnel uses the various test method, such as unit testing, system testing and regression testing to properly test the application. 

- Developer: Will be responsible for developing the application; build software, fix any bugs the software may have and maintain the software.
